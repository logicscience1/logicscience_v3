      <description>powerBI is a tool from Microsoft that is very good for visualising data and publishing to the powerBI service. I use it at work where we have substantial access to microsoft tools. This is not a limiting factor however because similarly to working in R IDE with markdown and shiny, it is possible to include both python and R code with powerBi. There is also convenient connectors to almost any data source including Azure Blob storage which I currently use for my work data.</description>
